The frontend for Mail Archive uses Bootstrap 5. Source SASS files can be found in
the frontend/scss directory.

bootstrap_custom.scss:  a simple SASS file that combines bootstrap w/ customizations
_custom.scss:           a SASS partial with overrides of bootstrap variables
styles.scss:            the SASS file for the archive project


How to rebuild from source

Initialize frontend directory
> cd frontend/
> npm install           # installs node_modules/ packages

Rebuild CSS files
> npm run build



Making Changes

Overrides to Bootstrap SCSS are made in frontend/scss/_custom.scss. All bootstrap
variables can be found in node_modules/bootstrap/scss/_variables.scss. To 
override a variable include it in _custom.scss but without the "!default" bit.

See documentation here: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/customize/sass/.


** The underscore indicates a partial, Sass files that are only meant to be imported, not compiled on their own.
